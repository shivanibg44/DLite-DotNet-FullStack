<h2>Without Clearfix</h2>

<p>This image is floated to the right. It is also taller than the element containing it, so it overflows outside of its container:</p>

<div>
  <img class="img1" src="workplace.jpg" alt="workplace" width="170" height="170">
  If a floated element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container. We can then add a clearfix hack to solve this problem
</div>

<h2 style="clear:right">With Clearfix</h2>
<p>We can fix this by adding a clearfix class with overflow: auto; to the containing element:</p>

<div class="clearfix">
  <img class="img2" src="workplace.jpg" alt="workplace" width="170" height="170">
