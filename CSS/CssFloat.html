<h2>Float Right</h2>

<p>In this example, the image will float to the right in the paragraph, and the text in the paragraph will wrap around the image.</p>

<p><img class="one" src="workplace.jpg" alt="Computer" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
The float Property
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.<p>
