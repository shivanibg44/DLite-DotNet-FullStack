        Flexbox includes a number of properties that allow you to define a flexible box, as well as the behavior of the items inside it.

First, you declare the flex container by applying display: flex or display: inline-flex to it. This establishes a new flex formatting context for its contents.

Once you have a flex container, you can then apply the various flex properties to its children. The flex property is shorthand for the main flex properties, and it goes like this:

Here, we specify that the normal box "grow factor" is 1 and the larger box is 3. The grow factor specifies how much the flex item grows relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container.
