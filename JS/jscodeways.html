            3 Places to put JavaScript code
Between the body tag of html
Between the head tag of html
In .js file (external javaScript)
        </pre>
        <p>Welcome to JavaScript</p>  
<form>  
<input type="button" value="click" onclick="msg1()"/>  
</form>  
<script type="text/javascript">  
    alert("Welcome to javascript(BODY TAG)");  
   </script> 

   <form>  
       <pre>
        Advantages of External JavaScript
        There will be following benefits if a user creates an external javascript:
        
        It helps in the reusability of code in more than one HTML file.
        It allows easy code readability.
        It is time-efficient as web browsers cache the external js files, which further reduces the page loading time.
        It enables both web designers and coders to work with html and js files parallelly and separately, i.e., without facing any code conflictions.
        The length of the code reduces as only we need to specify the location of the js file.
        Disadvantages of External JavaScript
        There are the following disadvantages of external files:
        
        The stealer may download the coder's code using the url of the js file.
        If two js files are dependent on one another, then a failure in one file may affect the execution of the other dependent file.
        The web browser needs to make an additional http request to get the js code.
        A tiny to a large change in the js code may cause unexpected results in all its dependent files.
        We need to check each file that depends on the commonly created external javascript file.
        If it is a few lines of code, then better to implement the internal javascript code
