        <h1>INHERITANCE</h1>
        <pre>
            The JavaScript inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

The JavaScript extends keyword is used to create a child class on the basis of a parent class. It facilitates child class to acquire all the properties and behavior of its parent class.

Points to remember
It maintains an IS-A relationship.
The extends keyword is used in class expressions or class declarations.
Using extends keyword, we can acquire all the properties and behavior of the inbuilt object as well as custom classes.
The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.

       <script>
            //Inhertiance example
            class Bike
{
  constructor()
  {
    this.company="Honda";
  }
}
class Vehicle extends Bike 
{
  constructor(name,price)
   {
     //By calling the super() method in the constructor method,
     // we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods
   super();
    this.name=name;
    this.price=price;
  } 
}
var v = new Vehicle("Shine","70000");
document.writeln(v.company+" "+v.name+" "+v.price);

                //In the JavaScript Date object, when you call getMonth() it returns the month but it counts from 0.
                document.writeln(m.getDate()+"-"+(m.getMonth()+1)+"-"+m.getFullYear());
