<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>
<p>In programming, data types is an important concept.</p>
<p>To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.</p>
<p>Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes</p>
<p>JavaScript has only one type of numbers.Numbers can be written with, or without decimals</p>
<p>Booleans can only have two values: true or false</p>

<p id="demo"></p>
<p id="demo1"></p>
<p id="demo2"></p>
<p>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.</p>
<p id="demo3"></p>
