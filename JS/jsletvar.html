    <p>
        var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.
    </p>
    <script>
        // calling x after definition
        var x = 5;
        document.write(x, "\n");
  
        // calling y after definition 
        let y = 10;
        document.write(y, "\n");
  
        // calling var z before definition will return undefined
        document.write(z, "\n");
        var z = 2;
  
        // calling let a before definition will give error
        document.write(a);
        let a = 3;
    </script>
    <hr>
    <p>If I declare a let variable at the global scope, then redeclare it within a block (curly brackets) as in the example below, I will not get an error in the console, but it will not actually redeclare let.</p>
    <p>Because let winner = false and let winner = true, are actually two separate variables because they are scoped differently, even though they have the same name.</p>
    <script>

        let points = 50;
let winner = false;
if(points > 40) 
{
  let winner = true;
  
}
document.write(winner);
// If I call: winner
// It returns the first value: false
// change let to var and see the output
    </script>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        const x = 2;     // Allowed
x = 2;           // Not allowed
var x = 2;       // Not allowed
let x = 2;       // Not allowed
const x = 2;     // Not allowed

{
  const x = 2;   // Allowed
  x = 2;         // Not allowed
  var x = 2;     // Not allowed
  let x = 2;     // Not allowed
  const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}
    </pre>
    <p>The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

        Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
        
        Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
        
        Variables defined with const have Block Scope.</p>
    <script>
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
