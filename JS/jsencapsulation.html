        <h1>ENCAPSULATION</h1>
            <p>Encapsulation â€“ The process of wrapping property and function within a single unit is known as encapsulation.</p>
            <p>Encapsulation is a method of making a complex system easier to handle for end users. The user need not worry about internal details and complexities of the system. Encapsulation is a process of wrapping the data and the code, that operate on the data into a single entity. You can assume it as a protective wrapper that stops random access of code defined outside that wrapper.</p>
        <pre>
            The JavaScript Encapsulation is a process of binding the data (i.e. variables) with the functions acting on that data. It allows us to control the data and validate it. To achieve an encapsulation in JavaScript: -

Use var keyword to make data members private.
Use setter methods to set the data and getter methods to get that data.
The encapsulation allows us to handle an object using the following properties:

Read/Write - Here, we use setter methods to write the data and getter methods read that data.

Read Only - In this case, we use getter methods only.
