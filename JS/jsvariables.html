<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>

<pre>JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.

You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable.

JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.

In JavaScript, let is a keyword that is used to declare a block scoped variable. 

Usually, the var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript which is treated as a normal variable, but the variables declared using the let keyword are block scoped.

JavaScript provides three ways to declare a variable: var, const, and let. 

These keywords deliver different functionality from each other. 

Var(function scoped) is a traditional method to declare a variable while const and let(block scoped) keyword was introduced later by the ES2015/ES6, which is to create block scope variable.

Var is defined throughout the program compared to let

var carName = "Volvo";

// Here a is 10


{  
  
  let a = 2;
  let b=5;  //local scope
  document.write("Local Scope"+b+"<br>");
  // Here a is 2  
}

{
   let b=3;// Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed
}

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is " + z + ".";  //variable

document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = 10.50; //literal

document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = (5 + 6) * 10; //operators


document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = carName;

document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = "Global Scope"+a;
