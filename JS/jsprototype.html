            JavaScript is a prototype-based language that facilitates the objects to acquire properties and features from one another. 
            Here, each object contains a prototype object.
            In JavaScript, whenever a function is created the prototype property is added to that function automatically. 
            This property is a prototype object that holds a constructor property.
            Whenever an object is created in JavaScript, its corresponding functions are loaded into memory. 
            So, a new copy of the function is created on each object creation.
            In a prototype-based approach, all the objects share the same function. 
            This ignores the requirement of creating a new copy of function for each object. 
            Thus, the functions are loaded once into the memory.
            JavaScript is a dynamic language. You can attach new properties to an object at any time as shown below.

            All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:

Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

Adding Properties and Methods to Objects
Sometimes you want to add new properties (or methods) to all existing objects of a given type.

Sometimes you want to add new properties (or methods) to an object constructor.

        <h1>Attach property to object</h1>
	
	<script>    
	function Student()
   {
		this.name = 'John';
		this.gender = 'M';
	}

	var studObj1 = new Student();
	studObj1.age = 15;
	document.write(studObj1.age+"<br>");

	var studObj2 = new Student();
	document.write(studObj2.age); 
	</script>	
  
  <pre>
    As you can see in the above example, age property is attached to studObj1 instance. 
    
    However, studObj2 instance will not have age property because it is defined only on studObj1 instance.

    So what to do if we want to add new properties at later stage to a function which will be shared across all the instances?
    
    <b>The answer is Prototype.</b>
    
    The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript, 
    
    where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property is not visible.
    
    Every function includes prototype object by default.

    The prototype object is special type of enumerable object to which additional properties can be attached 
    
    to it which will be shared across all the instances of it's constructor function.

    So, use prototype property of a function in the above example in order to have age properties across all the objects as shown below.

  <h1>Prototype</h1>
	
	<script>    
	function Student()
   {
		this.name = 'John';
		this.gender = 'M';
	}
 

	Student.prototype.age = 15;

	var studObj1 = new Student();
	document.write(studObj1.age+"<br>"); 

	var studObj2 = new Student();
	document.write(studObj2.age+"<br>"); 
  //As mentioned above, each object's prototype is linked to function's prototype object.
  // If you change function's prototype then only new objects will be linked to changed prototype. 
  //All other existing objects will still link to old prototype of function. 
  Student.prototype ={ age : 20 };
  var studObj3 = new Student();
	document.write(studObj3.age+"<br>"); 
  document.write(studObj1.age+"<br>"); 
  document.write(studObj2.age+"<br>"); 
	</script>	
  <hr>
  <h1>Prototype</h1>
	<script>    
	function Student() 
  {
		this.name = 'John';
		this.gender = 'Male';
	}

	var studObj = new Student();

	Student.prototype.sayHi= function()
  {
		document.write("Hi");
	};

	var studObj1 = new Student();
	var proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(studObj1); 
        
	document.write(proto.constructor); 
	</script>

  <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
  <p>The JavaScript prototype property also allows you to add new methods to objects constructors</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function Person(first, last, age, eye) 
{
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
}

Person.prototype.name = function()
 {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};

const n = new Person("Paul", "Walker", 36, "blue");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML ="My name is " + n.name();
document.write(n.name());
</script>
